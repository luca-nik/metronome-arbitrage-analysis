# Metronome Arbitrage Analysis: Risk-Free Arbitrage in Metronome 1.0

This repository presents an in-depth analysis of arbitrage opportunities within the [Metronome (MET)](https://metronome.io/) cryptocurrency ecosystem, with a specific focus on the [Autonomous Converter Contract (ACC)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x686e5ac50d9236a9b7406791256e47feddb26aba). The analysis explores risk-free arbitrage strategies made possible by Metronome's unique economic mechanisms, and how they can be leveraged in algorithmic trading.

## Overview

Metronome 1.0 features a unique dual-price mechanism that creates potential arbitrage opportunities. This project provides:

- A **mathematical framework** to analyze these arbitrage opportunities.
- A proposed **high-frequency trading strategy** to maximize profits while maintaining ecosystem stability.
- Python simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

The detailed results and analysis can be found in the accompanying PDF document, **MetronomeArbitrage.pdf**, which outlines the strategy, equations, and key findings of the research.

## Key Features

- **Arbitrage Mechanics**: Analyzes the conditions under which arbitrage between Metronomeâ€™s Daily Price Auction (DPA) and ACC occurs.
- **High-Frequency Trading Strategy**: Proposes a trading strategy designed to exploit these opportunities effectively.
- **Simulation Results**: Provides Python code and simulations for the proposed strategy, demonstrating its viability in a decentralized environment.
